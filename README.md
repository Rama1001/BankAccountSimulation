# Bank Account Simulation

## Description
This is a Java-based **Bank Account Simulation** developed as part of the Elevate Labs Java Developer Internship (Task 5).  
It allows a user to perform **basic banking operations** via a menu-driven console interface while maintaining a transaction history.

The project demonstrates key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as:
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Class design and object interaction
